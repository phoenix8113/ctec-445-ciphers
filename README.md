## Caesar Cipher

The Caesar cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. The shift value is known as the "key." This cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who is historically known to have used it for secure communication.

### Usage

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
